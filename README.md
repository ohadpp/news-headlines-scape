# Web Scraping Headlines from The Sun Website

This project utilizes Selenium, a powerful web scraping library, to extract headlines, subtitles, and links from The Sun website (https://www.thesun.co.uk/). The extracted data is then organized into a structured format and saved to a CSV file.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Selenium
pandas
Installation
To run this project, ensure that you have Python installed. You can install the required Python packages using the following command:

pip install selenium pandas
Additionally, you need to download the ChromeDriver executable and specify its path in the script. You can download ChromeDriver from here.

## Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-scraping-sun-headlines.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd web-scraping-sun-headlines
Open the script (scrape_headlines.py) and update the path variable with the correct path to your ChromeDriver executable.

## Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python scrape_headlines.py
The script will launch a headless Chrome browser, scrape the headlines data, and save it to a CSV file named headline-DDMMYY.csv, where DDMMYY represents the current date.

## Script Explanation
The script uses Selenium to automate a Chrome browser, navigates to The Sun website, and extracts headlines data.
Extracted data includes the title, subtitle, and link for each headline.
The data is organized into dictionaries and then into a Pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation.
The final DataFrame is saved to a CSV file in the same directory as the script.
## Notes
Ensure that you have a stable internet connection as the script relies on real-time data from the website.
The script handles cases where elements are not found and prints a message when skipping a container.


## Acknowledgments
The project uses Selenium and Pandas, powerful tools for web automation and data manipulation, respectively.
